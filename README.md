## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

##Ghost behavior
- **Red**: Chases Pac-Man directly.
- **Turquise**: Targets 4 tiles ahead of Pac-Man.
- **Purple**: Combines Blinky's position and 2 tiles ahead of Pac-Man.
- **Yellow**: Chases if far away; retreats if too close.
